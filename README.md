# E-RIHS Controlled Lists

The various controlled lists presented here are being used within the development of documentation and data gathering exercises, in relation to Heritage Science research activities. They are part of the development of digital tools and services in relation to [E-RIHS](https://e-rihs.eu). It is planned that once the process of creation and editing of these controlled lists reaches a more robust and consistent level the various lists and their administration will be moved to a feature rich vocabulary service. which is currently expected to be hosted under https://vocabulary.e-rihs.io (this is not yet live).

The controlled lists added to this repository are being managed and created using a very fixed file and folder name protocol. This allows the lists content to be created and edited via simple TSV files and then more functional JSON formatted representations can be created automatically using the included [tsv2json](tsv2json.py) script.

**Please only edit the files within the tsv folder as indicated below**
