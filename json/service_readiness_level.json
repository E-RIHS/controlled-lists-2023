  "description": "# Service Readiness Level\n\nThe service readiness levels (SRL) are a method for estimating the maturity of services being offered or proposed in relation to the E-RIHS community. SRLs enable consistent and uniform discussions of technical maturity across different types of services. These levels are directly modelled on the more standard [Technology readiness levels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_readiness_level) and the common terms used to describe the development of software.\n\nIt is anticipated that services officially offered under the E-RIHS ERIC will generally be in the top few categories. However, many of the services offered to to the E-RIHS community are under active development, in order to provide the latest options to the HS researchers, therefore lower SLR levels may also be considered within the live catalogue of services.\n\nIn addition, the lower levels allow developing and proposed services to also be documented, this is particularly relevant to the development of new digital services. These more experimentative services, though potentially not included in the live E-RIHS catalogue of services, could still be made available at a National, Institutional or Personal level to facilitate testing and evaluation.\n\n### Referenced by\n* Field: **service_readiness_level** in the [Service metadata schema](https://github.com/E-RIHS/schema#service-metadata-schema)\n\n",
